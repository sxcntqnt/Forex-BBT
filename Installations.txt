a step-by-step guide on how to install and set up the advanced forex trading bot:

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.

Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in the terminal:

mkdir advanced_forex_bot
cd advanced_forex_bot

Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS and Linux: source venv/bin/activate
Install the required packages:

`Download C bindings for TA-Lib https://sourceforge.net/projects/ta-lib/`

tar -zxvf `the tar package`
./configure
make
sudo make install 

pip install -r requirements.txt

Note: Installing TA-Lib might be tricky on some systems. You may need to install it separately following the instructions for your operating system.

Create a .env file in the project directory and add your Deriv API token:
DERIV_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here

Run the bot:
python main.py

The bot will start running, and you can access the web interface at http://localhost:8080.

To interact with the bot through the web interface, you can use curl commands or any HTTP client:

Get bot status: curl http://localhost:8080/status
Start the bot: curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/start
Stop the bot: curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/stop
Run backtest: curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/backtest
Remember to replace your_api_token_here in the .env file with your actual Deriv API token.
